## Intoduction
The object of the project was to create 'a service-orientated architecture for your application, this application must be composed of at least 4 services that work together'. 
These services include service 1 which is the front-end of the webpage, service 2 and 3 which are randomsizers and service 4 which take values from service 2 and 3 and creates a reponce depending on those values. This all needs to be presented to the user on service 1 using a database to store the infoamtion.
